# Simple Digital Clock :watch:

## Introduction 
This is a simple Digital Clock made in C language.

## How It works :eyes:

* First, you are prompted to set the present time in the format HH:MM:SS and the clock takes it from there. 
* If you input the numbers with spaces between them, (e.g 11 2 25), the program takes it as 11:02:25 and continues the reading from 11:02:26.
*  If you input the numbers with columns between them, (e.g 11:02:25), the program takes continues the reading from the next hour (in this case, 12:00:00)
